# CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming (Public)
This repository stores the source files for the public-facing resources for our UW course, CSE 163: Intermediate Data Programming. 

## Note on Repo Structure
Much of this book was originally written in a learning tool used in our course called EdStem. EdStem allows for interactivity with code in both the readings and practice problems, which this public version is not able to provide. Since the repo that stores the original EdStem files also contains assignment solutions, we assume the directory of raw EdStem files lives outside of this repo in order to generate a new version of the site.
