---------------------------------- Commentary 

The license for this repo is much like the license for [Crafting Interpreters](https://github.com/munificent/craftinginterpreters/blob/master/LICENSE). 

Most of the content of this repo is text and video that I created, so feels 
a bit more "me" than just any code in the book. So like Crafting Interpreters, 
we will use two licenses, one for the "text" of the book and the other for the 
surrounding code.
