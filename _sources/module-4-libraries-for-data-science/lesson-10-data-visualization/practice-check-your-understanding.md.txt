# 🚧 Practice: Check your understanding

*Make sure you read all instructions on this page* .  

The following questions are here to help you test your understanding of the past reading so far!  


## Question 0

Suppose I had this small dataset (shown below) in a variable called `df`. We want to only filter `df` so that we have all the data but the rows where `'C'` is `NaN`.  

Which of the following methods successfully filters this dataset as described?  


| A | B | C |
|--:|--:|--:|
|  1|  2|NaN|
|  3|NaN|  4|
|  5|  6|NaN|
|NaN|  7|  8|
|  9| 10| 11|
