# ðŸš§ Practice: Plotting 2

{download}`Download starter code </module-4-libraries-for-data-science/lesson-10-data-visualization/practice-plotting-2.zip>`

In this problem, we will work with the same iris dataset, but this time the dataset contains some missing values. As a reminder, the dataset has the columns  

-  `sepal_width`     for the width of the flower's sepal  

-  `sepal_length`     for the length of the flower's sepal  

-  `petal_width`     for the width of the flower's petal  

-  `petal_length`     for the length of the flower's petal  

-  `species`     for which species of iris it is (one of     `'setosa'`     ,     `'versicolor'`     , or     `'virginica'`     ).  


For this problem, we have provided no starter code so you will need to recreate it from the last problem! The dataset is stored in `iris_missing.csv` (remember, you will need to specify it as `/home/iris_missing.csv` on Ed).  

First, make a **regression plot** of the dataset stored in `df` with the petal length on the x-axis and the sepal length on the y-axis. The color of the points and the line should be green (use code `'g'` )! Any rows with missing values should be given a value of 0. Look back at the lesson to identify which functions you can use to help you make this plot.  

Second, customize the plot using `matplotlib` to set the following properties  

-  The x-axis should be labeled     `Petal Length (cm)`   

-  The y-axis should be labeled     `Sepal Length (cm)`   

-  The title of the graph should be     `Petal Length vs Sepal Length`   


Save your image to `/home/plot.png` . Remember you will need to pass that extra parameter to make the layout tight.

Do not customize the chart in any other way! Part of this test is actually comparing the images so if you add any difference, you might fail the tests!

```

Your final plot should look like this:
