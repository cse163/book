# ðŸš§ Practice: find_range

{download}`Download starter code </module-1-introduction-to-python/lesson-3-strings-and-lists/practice-find_range.zip>`

Write a function named `find_range` that accepts a `list` of `int` s as a parameter and returns the range of values contained in the list. The range is defined to be one more than the difference between its largest and smallest elements.  

For example, consider the list `[12, 17, 6]` . The largest element in this list is `17` and the smallest is `6` , so the range is `12` (one more than `17 - 6` ). If the largest and smallest values are the same, the range is `1` .  

###  Requirements  

-  You may assume that the list contains at least one element (that its length is at least 1).  

-  You should not modify the contents of the list.  

-  You should not use a "nested-loop" to solve this problem (a loop inside a loop).
