# <i class="far fa-edit fa-fw"></i> Practice: Slices

For all the following questions, assume we are using the string

```{snippet}
s = 'I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox'
```

For this checkpoint, you should do these by hand and not type the lines into a computer.

Please write your answers **without** surrounding quotes. This means if the substring returns would have been the string `'have eaten'`, you should write:

```text
have eaten
```

Make sure you get the casing/spacing right!
