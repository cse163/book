Write a program that counts down from a minute in decrements of 10 seconds using a `for` loop. The output of the program should be the following:

```text
One minute countdown
60
50
40
30
20
10
0
Done!
```

_Hint: The lines of numbers should all be produced by your for loop while the first and last lines will appear outside the loop (since they only happen once)._

_Hint: Think carefully about what the inputs to `range` will be! The parameter values are allowed to be negative! Ask yourself what the sequence of values need to be and what the values you need to pass to `range` are!_

## Requirements

- Your solution should use a `for` loop and should not use a `while` loop.

- Your program should use the main-method pattern (we provided the starter code). You do not need to define any other functions for this problem!

## Running Instructions

- To complete this practice, download the starter code using the link at the top of the reading slide and open it on your local editor.
- Remember to run your program you can use the terminal by using the command `python main.py` (since the name of the file is `main.py` ).
