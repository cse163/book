# Class Today

Class today will look a bit different! We will do a quick recap of the material and have time for questions like normal. But most of the class will be dedicated to helping you find a group for the project if you don't have one yet.  

We will post more details on how this will run soon. The process we will do will also be designed for asynchronous participants in mind, so it's okay if you aren't able to attend class or find a group by the end, the process we will use will stay open!
