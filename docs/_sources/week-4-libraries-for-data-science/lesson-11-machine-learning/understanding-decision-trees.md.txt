# Understanding Decision Trees
Read this incredible article that does a visual walkthrough of what a decision tree model is and how the learning algorithm learns it from a dataset! [None](http://www.r2d3.us/visual-intro-to-machine-learning-part-1/) . This article uses the same dataset we did in the last slide (we actually borrowed it from them!), so that you can understand what this decision tree is learning behind the scenes.  
You can stop at the section called "Reality Check" that talks about overfitting. We will talk about this topic in Lesson 12!
