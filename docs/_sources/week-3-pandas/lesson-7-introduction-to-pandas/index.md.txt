# ðŸ“š Lesson 7: Introduction to Pandas
## Context for Week

Last week we started to see how to process these CSV files. We used the list of dictionaries representation to help us answer these questions.

While the list of dictionaries format was helpful, it was still a bit tedious to write all that code. This week, we will learn about a
**library**
that puts most of this tedious code "behind the scenes" so you don't have to write as much. A library is essentially code someone else wrote and packaged up so you can use it. The library we will learn how to use this week is called
`pandas`
.
