# Neural Networks
To introduce yourself to Neural Networks, we want you to watch a video from a YouTube channel called 3Blue1Brown. 3Blue1Brown is one of Nicole's favorite YouTube channels about mathematics and their videos are very accessible and well done.

You can find a link to the video below, but first, we want to highlight some things we really want you to get out of the video and some things you can skim over and not focus on as much. You should read these lists first even though they won't make much sense yet. Then after watching the video, review these key points to make sure you got what we wanted you from it.

```{warning}
In their video, 3Blue1Brown uses grayscale images with pixel values between 0.0 (black) and 1.0 (white) instead of our 0 to 255. These are equivalent, just different scales that are both commonly used!

```

There is a whole series of videos that you are welcome to watch if you're interested, but we will only focus on the first one.
