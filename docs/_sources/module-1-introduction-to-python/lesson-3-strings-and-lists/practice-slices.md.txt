# 🚧 Practice: Slices

For all the following questions, assume we are using the string  

```python
s = 'I have eaten the plums that were in the icebox'
```

For this checkpoint, you should do these by hand and not type the lines into a computer.  

Please write your answers **without** surrounding quotes. This means if the substring returns would have been the string `'have eaten'` , you should write:  

```text
have eaten
````

Make sure you get the casing/spacing right!
