We will use the recording I made last quarter for this lecture (it's weird seeing my hair short). I've tried my best to scrub out irrelevant logistic details (exam, project stuff), but I couldn't cleanly remove them all.
**You should ignore any instructions about exam/project in this video**
since it might not be relevant to our policies this quarter.
