# Privacy in Practice: The Census
Before trying to more formally define this more complex notion of privacy and how to achieve it, we want to let our friends at Minute Physics show a recent example of how it is used in practice. We do this because they provide a very good intuition for what this notion of privacy tries to capture and how applicable it is to real-world problems like the US Census. Watch the video below to find out more! It's okay if you slow down the Youtube video a bit since the Minute Physics guy can sometimes talk a bit fast.
