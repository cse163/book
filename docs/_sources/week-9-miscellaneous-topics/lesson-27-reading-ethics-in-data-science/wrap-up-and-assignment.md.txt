##  Wrap-up  

So now that we have seen these 5 case studies, hopefully, this gives you a bit of a framework to think critically about new data science applications (that you hear about or are trying to build). It's not going to be the case that every example you see will correspond exactly to one of these case studies. However, you can hopefully take some of the key takeaways from each case study as a guiding set of questions or things to think of when considering the ethics of an application.  
If you find that you see something that doesn't look quite right, try to identify what assumptions they are making that is leading them to the wrong conclusion. It's rare that people do a bad or incorrect analysis maliciously. Rather, they normally don't think of one of these common pitfalls and that lack of awareness leads them astray.  
Ask yourself hard questions about your projects: Who are the stakeholders? Who will this help and how? Who might this hurt and how?  Whenever you are doing anything with modeling, uncertainty will be a fact of life. Think about what errors are tolerable and which are not, and design your system to make errors less impactful. There is a famous quote often attributed to the statistician George Box that says:  
> All models are wrong, but some are useful.
##  Assignment  

When meeting in person, this class session focuses on discussing these case studies. We talk about the ethics of these applications, if they relate to any experiences we have had in our lives, or ideas for how to we could improve these case studies to avoid ethical concerns we might have. We aren't sure this format will work super well in the Zoom setting, so we are going to try something slightly different. Your practice problem for today is to post on the course discussion board reflecting on what you learned today and sharing your opinion or experience relating to one of the topics addressed in this lesson.  
Each quiz section will have its own discussion board post for students in that section to participate in a discussion about this lesson. The point here is to have you all engage in a discussion about these topics since they are so important, so please take advantage of this opportunity to go in deep!  
To earn credit for this lesson, you need to post on the discussion board post for your assigned quiz section on MyUW before our normal lesson deadline of 21:00 PDT on the day of this lesson. You are allowed to post anonymously (since we can see who you are, but other students can't), and your post can either be a new top-level comment or a follow-up to someone else's comment. Your post does not have to be overly long; a paragraph suffices since we are not looking for you to write an essay.  
A valid post is unique and reflects on what you learned and specifically talks about one of the concepts from the reading (i.e., demonstrates that you did the reading). This can be in the form of sharing your opinion on one of these case studies and whether or not it's ethical to use them, adding on to the considerations we shared (or objecting to any of the points we shared), or relating what you learned to some other application you have seen. **You do not need to talk about every case study in your response, it's okay to focus on one** ; you are more than welcome to relate different case studies though! Additionally, you can respond to someone else's post to add a different perspective or disagree with their point and elaborate on why; a debate is good, but **remember to be respectful** and make sure we are asking critical questions about what we believe! Do remember that you are just one voice and other people likely have different opinions than you. On top of your reflection or response to someone else's post, you are welcome to pose any additional discussion questions that people can follow up with!  
You should not merely state the same thing someone else in your quiz section says. That means before posting, you should read through the other responses in your quiz section's discussion thread to make sure what you are going to share is not just the same opinion as someone else.  
You don't need to spend a ton of time worrying if your post is enough; we want you to participate in the discussion and gain something new from your classmates' perspectives. As long as you put in a serious effort to meet our requirements and demonstrate that you did the reading, you will earn credit!  
###  Discussion Board Posts  

You should post in the thread for your quiz section. Make sure you check your quiz section on MyUW to make sure you are posting in the right one!
