# ðŸš§Practice: Population in South America

{download}`Download starter code </module-7-geospatial-data/lesson-18-geospatial-data-misc-python/practice-population-in-south-america.zip>`

Write a program in `main.py` that reads in the world dataset shown in an earlier slide and makes a plot of just the countries in South America colored by their population (using the column `'POP_EST'` ). The plot should have a legend explaining the colors. Save the plot to a file called `south_america.png` .  
Some notes on your implementation:  
-  Recall that a     `GeoDataFrame`     is just like a     `DataFrame`     so you can filter down to just the rows for countries in South America (where the     `'CONTINENT'`     column has value     `'South America'`     ).  
-  The data can be found at     `/course/lecture-readings/geo_data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp`     .  
-  You should save the result to     `south_america.png`     . DO NOT save it to     `/home/south_america.png`     .  
-  Instead of the "Run" button, we now have a "Check" button to help you verify the output of your program.     **You still need to press Mark to submit.**   
-  Your program should use the main-method pattern and should not use any global variables. Your final result should look like this:
