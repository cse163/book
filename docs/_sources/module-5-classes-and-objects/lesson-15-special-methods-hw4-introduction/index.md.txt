# ðŸ“š Lesson 15: Special Methods + HW4 Introduction


```{admonition} Note
:class: note

Class session for Lesson 15 will be slightly different than the others. Since there is less material to practice, we will not have the same structure class as usual. We will start class with a short recap like usual, and then the rest of the time will be spent in breakouts with TAs walking around. You will likely finish early so there is no need to stick around til the end since we won't be doing any recap. Please feel free to still show up to talk with your peers and TAs though!
<br />

<br />
We put the Practice problems before the Pause and Think to reflect that you might be interested in doing these on your own since we are going to have fewer interactions in class on Friday.

```

##  Concepts  

In this lesson, you will learn the following concepts:  
-  Why we need the main method pattern  
-  Equality vs Identity  
-  How to implement classes so they can be used with Python's built-in syntax  
-  Introduction to HW4  

##  Ed Lessons  

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:  
-  Do the reading on your own time before our class session for today's lesson. Also, respond to the "Pause and Think" question.  
-  Call into the class-session prepared to work in groups on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running with your group.  
    -  We will periodically summarize high-level ideas of the practice problems in the class session.  
    -  TAs will "walk-around" Zoom breakouts so you can ask them any questions!  

-  Finish up any of the practice problems afterward!
