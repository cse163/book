## Question 0

Are you coming to class for today's lesson? Make sure to update your group on [None](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1432114/groups#tab-115733) as described below:  

-  If you are planning to attend, please make sure you are listed in some group on Canvas to facilitate forming breakout groups; even if you just pick a group at random, this is very helpful for assigning breakout rooms!  

-  If you aren't planning on coming, please make sure you aren't assigned to a group. This helps us  avoid having groups that are too small due to no-shows.
