# ðŸš§Practice: Small and Rich

{download}`Download starter code </week-7-geospatial-data/lesson-18-geospatial-data-misc-python/practice-small-and-rich.zip>`

Write a program in `main.py` that reads in the world dataset shown in an earlier slide and makes a plot of the world highlighting the countries that are "small and rich". A country is rich if it's GDP (from the column `GDP_MD_EST` ) is at least 500,000. A country is small if its population (from the column is `POP_EST` ) is at most 80,000,000. The plot should show the GDP as the color of each country. Unlike the last problem, you should also plot the entire world map on the same plot but in a light gray (passing in `color='#EEEEEE'` ) so it's clearer where these small and rich countries are. The plot should have a legend explaining the colors. Save the plot to a file called `small_and_rich.png` .  
Some notes on your implementation:  
-  Recall that a     `GeoDataFrame`     is just like a     `DataFrame`     so you can filter down to just the rows for countries that meet our definition.  
-  When creating the figure, please pass in     `figsize=(15, 7)`     to make the result large enough to be legible.  
-  *Hint: You'll need to think carefully about how to plot the whole world and the desired countries on the same plot!*   
-  The data can be found at     `/course/lecture-readings/geo_data/ne_110m_admin_0_countries.shp`     .  
-  You should save the result to     `small_and_rich.png`     . DO NOT save it to     `/home/small_and_rich.png`     .  
-  Instead of the "Run" button, we now have a "Check" button to help you verify the output of your program.     **You still need to press Mark to submit.**   
-  Your program should use the main-method pattern and should not use any global variables. Your final result should look like this:
