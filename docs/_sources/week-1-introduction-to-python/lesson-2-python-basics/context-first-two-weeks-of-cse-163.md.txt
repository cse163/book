# Context: First Two Weeks of CSE 163


```{admonition} Tip
:class: tip

In addition to these readings, I will also be recording short videos of me walking through the content of the reading. I don't always have time to go through every single detail in the reading, so the reading should still be your primary source for course content. Students in the past reported that they liked having the videos for commentatry and context.
<br />

<br />

**The videos are optional, and all required content is in the reading itself**
. You can listen to the video as you go along, or just do the reading on it's own. Whatever you prefer!

In the first lesson, we introduced the purpose and place of this course and introduced a lot of the important points from the [None](https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse163/21wi/syllabus.html) .  
Recall that without the exams, we have a little more time this quarter, so we are purposefully trying to slow down the pace of the beginning a little. Many students have reported this part of the quarter is quite difficult to adjust to a new language.  
Now, this doesn't mean the first two weeks will be easy! You will be learning a lot of new tools and many of you are learning Python for the first time! But our hope is that this deliberate practice we are setting up will make this transition easier!  
<hr>
In this lesson, we will learn many of the basics constructs for Python that can be used to formulate almost any program.  

```{admonition} Note
:class: note

As a reminder, how you will view these first two weeks will depend on which class you took as a prerequisite:
<br />

<br />
If you took CSE 142 (or some other Java course): This week (and part of next) will be learning almost all of the things you already learned in 142 but in Python. It can be challenging and confusing at first, but we promise it gets better as you practice!
**Most importantly, try to relate what you're learning this week back to Java**
. Almost all of these ideas are ones you've seen before (e.g. an
`if`
statement), but have a different
*syntax*
to write them in Python.
<br />

<br />
If you took CSE 160: This week and next will be lots of reviews. We promise that by the start of next week you will see some more complex data processing than you've seen in 160! After next week, everything will be brand new to you.
