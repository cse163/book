# ðŸ“š Lesson 15: Special Methods + HW4 Introduction
```{info}
Class session for Lesson 15 will be slightly different than the others. Since there is less material to practice, we will not have the same structure class as usual. We will start class with a short recap like usual, and then the rest of the time will be spent in breakouts with TAs walking around. You will likely finish early so there is no need to stick around til the end since we won't be doing any recap. Please feel free to still show up to talk with your peers and TAs though!

We put the Practice problems before the Pause and Think to reflect that you might be interested in doing these on your own since we are going to have fewer interactions in class on Friday.
