This slide lives on Google Colaboratory. Ed is not able to handle the dataset here and we also want to give you a little exposure with Colab! While the interface looks different than the standard Jupyter Notebook interface Ed provides, all the ideas are the same! You can find the notebook [None](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/13qIQ1NFjAXV4eT3gQCxPnFWTic9XQrT1#forceEdit=true&sandboxMode=true) .  
*Note: You can't save any changes in this Notebook without doing an extra step. Please see the top of the notebook for instructions.*
