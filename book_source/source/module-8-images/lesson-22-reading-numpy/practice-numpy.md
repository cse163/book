This quiz was originally bugged by only allowing you one submission and then showing the answer after. We have enabled multiple attempts and the answer will be shown after you submit. You will still need to mark to correct answer to be counted as completed, but please make an effort to try before blindly clicking one to see the right answer.

The following questions will give you a chance to practice the new information and syntax you just saw about `numpy` . You should try to do these all by hand using your understanding of the material, and you should try to avoid plugging these into your computer.

Recall that learning a new library can be a daunting task since there is just so much information! You have a lot of experience learning libraries, so hopefully, this time is easier since you can rely on your past experience with `pandas` .

## Question 0

What is the shape of the following `numpy.array` ?

```python
np.arange(14)
```

Including the formatting of the `tuple` , but do not include spaces. For example, if it is a tuple of length 1 write something like `(4,)` and if it is a tuple of length 2, write something like `(1,2)` . There should be no spaces in your answer.



**üìù Your Task**

Write your answer down in your own space.

## Question 1

What is the shape of `m` in the following code block?

```python
x = np.arange(20).reshape((4, 5))
m = x / 2 + 1
```

Including the formatting of the `tuple` , but do not include spaces. For example, if it is a tuple of length 1 write something like `(4,)` and if it is a tuple of length 2, write something like `(1,2)` .



**üìù Your Task**

Write your answer down in your own space.

## Question 2

What is the shape of `m` in the following code block?

```python
x = np.arange(20).reshape((4, 5))
m = x[1:, 2:4]
```

Including the formatting of the `tuple` , but do not include spaces. For example, if it is a tuple of length 1 write something like `(4,)` and if it is a tuple of length 2, write something like `(1,2)` . There should be no spaces in your answer.



**üìù Your Task**

Write your answer down in your own space.

## Question 3

Suppose we had a `numpy.array` named `x` with some sequence of values. For this problem, assume we are not allowed to use the `!=` comparison (even though that's a totally valid approach).

Which of the following options will help us select all the values in `x` that are greater than 10 and are not divisible by 3.



**üìù Your Task**

Select one option. Write your answer down in your own space.

*‚ùì Option 0*

`x[x > 10 and not x % 3 == 0]`



*‚ùì Option 1*

`x[(x > 10) and not x % 3 == 0]`



*‚ùì Option 2*

`x[x > 10 & ~x % 3 == 0]`



*‚ùì Option 3*

`x[(x > 10) & ~(x % 3 == 0)]`



## Question 4

Now that we have learned about `numpy` , we can now explore the return value from `plt.subplots` . The return for the `Axes` is really a `numpy.array` of the given shape where each value is an `Axes` object!

For example, if we made a `subplots` using the following line, it would produce the figure below.

```text
fig, axs = plt.subplots(3, 4)
````

```{image} https://static.us.edusercontent.com/files/4sJPr39zfQ9hSrsobUDRuc19
:alt: TODO
:width: 691
:align: center
```

Where we have labeled each `Axes` in the variable `axs` as if we had unpacked it into the individual variables

```text
fig, [[ax1, ax2, ax3, ax4], [ax5, ax6, ax7, ax8], [ax9, ax10, ax11, ax12]] = plt.subplots(3, 4)
````

You can tell that as there are more plots, trying to unpack each `Axes` to a variable from the returned `numpy.array` is unwieldy. Instead, for large plots, it's common to just store the result in a variable `axs` and index into it.

Suppose we wanted to draw on `ax7` in the picture above. Which access to `axs` would give us a reference to that `Axes` object?



**üìù Your Task**

Select one option. Write your answer down in your own space.

*‚ùì Option 0*

`axs[0, 0]`



*‚ùì Option 1*

`axs[0, 1]`



*‚ùì Option 2*

`axs[0, 2]`



*‚ùì Option 3*

`axs[0, 3]`



*‚ùì Option 4*

`axs[0, 4]`



*‚ùì Option 5*

`axs[1, 0]`



*‚ùì Option 6*

`axs[1, 1]`



*‚ùì Option 7*

`axs[1, 2]`



*‚ùì Option 8*

`axs[1, 3]`



*‚ùì Option 9*

`axs[1, 4]`
