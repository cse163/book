# <i class="far fa-edit"></i> Practice: Broadcasting

What is the result of the following operation? For reference, we have shown the rules of broadcasting below.

```text
x = np.arange(3).reshape((3, 1))
y = np.arange(3)
x + y
````

##  Rules of Broadcasting

-  If the two arrays differ in their number of dimensions, the shape of the one with fewer dimensions is padded on it‚Äôs left side.

-  If the shape of two arrays does not match on any dimension, the array with shape equal to 1 in that dimension is stretched to match the other shape. This will happen for all dimensions that don't match and one has a shape equal to 1.

-  If in any dimension the sizes disagree and neither is equal to 1, an error is raised.
