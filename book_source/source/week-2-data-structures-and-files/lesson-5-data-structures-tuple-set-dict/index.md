# ðŸ“š Lesson 5: Data Structures - Tuple, Set, Dict
##  Concepts  

The remaining lessons this week are all focused on *data* and how to represent it in our programs. This lesson focuses on the concept of a **data structure** (something that stores data, e.g. a `list` ) while Lesson 6 will focus on an application of these data structures to represent a particular type of data that is used commonly in programs.  
In this lesson, you will learn about the following Python constructs:  
-  List comprehensions  
-  Tuples  
-  Sets  
-  Dictionaries  

##  Ed Lessons  

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:  
-  Do the reading on your own time before our class session for today's lesson. Do everything up to, and including the "Pause and Think" question before coming to class.  
-  Call into the class-session prepared to work in groups on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running with your group.  
    -  We will periodically summarize high-level ideas of the practice problems in the class session.  
    -  TAs will "walk-around" Zoom breakouts so you can ask them any questions!  

-  Finish up any of the practice problems afterward!
