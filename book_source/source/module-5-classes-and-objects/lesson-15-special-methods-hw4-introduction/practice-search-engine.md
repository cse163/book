# 🚧 Practice: Search Engine

Consider the corpus with the following documents (file name shown above text of file)  

**doc1.txt**   

```text
Dogs are the greatest pets.

````

**doc2.txt**   

```text
Cats seem pretty okay.

````

**doc3.txt**   

```text
I love dogs!

````

Recall that the search engine will be case-insensitive and remove punctuation.  

## Question 0

## Question 2

**(Select all that apply)** A later part of your assignment asks you to extend your `SearchEngine` to handle **multi-word queries** . A multi-word query is just a query that has more than one word in it like  

```text
greatest love
````

The rule for multi-word queries is you should return all documents that have at least one of the query words in it. What are the documents returned by this query above?
