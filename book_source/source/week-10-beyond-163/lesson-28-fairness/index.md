## Concepts

Last time we looked into case studies of how data science could go wrong (intentionally or unintentionally). In particular, when talking about the COMPAS example, we talked a bit about how a model can exhibit biased behavior. In this lesson, we want to dive more into what does fairness or bias even mean, and some work in trying to require that learned models are fair.

In this lesson, we will be focusing on an example of using various factors to predict admission to college. This is
