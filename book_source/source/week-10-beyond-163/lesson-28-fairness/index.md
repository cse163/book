##  Concepts  

Last time we looked into case studies of how data science could go wrong (intentionally or unintentionally). In particular, when talking about the COMPAS example, we talked a bit about how a model can exhibit biased behavior. In this lesson, we want to dive more into what does fairness or bias even mean, and some work in trying to require that learned models are fair.  
In this lesson, we will be focusing on an example of using various factors to predict admission to college. This is **not** because this is a system we endorse, but it is relevant to you as college students and a little easier-to-understand example that lets us explore what fairness might mean and how a system might ensure fairness.

This lesson is heavily inspired by The Ethical Algorithm by Michael Kearns and Aaron Roth. I highly recommend you check out their fantastic book!

##  Ed Lessons  

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:  
-  Do the reading on your own time before our class session for today's lesson. Do everything up to, and including the "Pause and Think" question before coming to class.  
-  Call into the class-session prepared to work in groups on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running with your group.  
    -  We will periodically summarize high-level ideas of the practice problems in the class session.  
    -  TAs will "walk-around" Zoom breakouts so you can ask them any questions!  

-  Finish up any of the practice problems afterward!
