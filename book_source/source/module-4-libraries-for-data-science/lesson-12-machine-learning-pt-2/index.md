# ðŸ“š Lesson 12: Machine Learning pt. 2

##  Concepts  

In this lesson, you will learn the following concepts:  

-  How to handle categorical data  

-  How to assess the quality of a model  

-  The concept of overfitting  

-  Controlling model complexity with hyperparameters  


##  Ed Lessons  

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:  

-  Do the reading on your own time before our class session for today's lesson. Also, respond to the "Pause and Think" question.  

-  Call into the class-session prepared to work in groups on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running with your group.  

    -  We will periodically summarize high-level ideas of the practice problems in the class session.  

    -  TAs will "walk-around" Zoom breakouts so you can ask them any questions!  


-  Finish up any of the practice problems afterward!
