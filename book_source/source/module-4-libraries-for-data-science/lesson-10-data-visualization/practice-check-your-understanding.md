The following questions are here to help you test your understanding of the past reading so far!

## Question 0

Suppose I had this small dataset (shown below) in a variable called `df`. We want to only filter `df` so that we have all the data but the rows where `'C'` is `NaN`.

Which of the following methods successfully filters this dataset as described?

|   A |   B |   C |
| --: | --: | --: |
|   1 |   2 | NaN |
|   3 | NaN |   4 |
|   5 |   6 | NaN |
| NaN |   7 |   8 |
|   9 |  10 |  11 |
