# Case Study 4: Facial Recognition
##  Task  

Read this [None](https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/09/technology/facial-recognition-race-artificial-intelligence.html?module=inline) on the use of facial recognition in machine learning.  
###  Recap  

The data we use to train our model affects the results of our model. This can lead to discriminatory practices. If our model under-represents or over-represents different groups that can bias our results.  Thus, it is important to evaluate the diversity in your dataset and evaluate our results on a diverse dataset and to keep in mind what we are using this model for.
