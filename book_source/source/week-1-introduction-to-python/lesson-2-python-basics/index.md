# ðŸ“š Lesson 2: Python Basics

## Concepts

In this lesson, you will learn about the following Python constructs:

- How to run your first Python program
- Variables and Expressions
- Types and Booleans
- Control Structures (Loops and Conditionals)
- Functions

## Ed Lessons

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:

- Do the reading on your own time before our class session for today's lesson. Also, respond to the "Pause and Think" question.
- Call into the class-session prepared to work in groups on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running with your group.

  - We will periodically summarize high-level ideas of the practice problems in the class session.
  - TAs will "walk-around" Zoombreakouts so you can ask them any questions!

- Finish up any of the practice problems afterward.
