# ‚è∏ Pause and üß† Think

At this point, you've finished the lesson content so all that's left are the practice problems for the day! You are welcome to continue doing these on your own time, but we recommend coming to the live class session for this lesson and working on the problems with your peers. Working on a problem with someone else can really help solidify your understanding of the material! **Remember that whether or not you decide to come to class, all slides (including the practice problems) are due at 19:00 PDT on the day of this lesson.**   

Before you go onto the practice problems though, we want you to think back on what you've seen so far. There are most likely some questions about what you've seen so far, and in the off-case there is not, there must be something related to this that you would like to learn more about. We recommend doing this before coming to the class session to work on the practice problems with your peers.  

Take a few moments to summarize (in your own words) what you learned in this less and write down a couple of questions you have about this lesson. **This is graded on effort and that your answer looks like it is a serious attempt at reflecting on your learning.**
