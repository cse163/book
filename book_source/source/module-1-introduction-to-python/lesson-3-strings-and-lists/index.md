# ðŸ“š Lesson 3: Strings and Lists

##  Concepts  

In this lesson, you will learn about the following Python constructs:  

-  Strings  

-  Lists  

-  None  

-  How to document your code  


##  Lessons

As a reminder, our suggested way of doing this lesson follows these steps:  

-  Do the reading first and respond to the "Pause and Think" question.  

-  Work on the practice problems. It will help to have your notes (and answers from Pause and Think) ready so you can hit the ground running when
you start working.
