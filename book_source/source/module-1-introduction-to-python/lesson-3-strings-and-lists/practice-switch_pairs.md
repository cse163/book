Write a function named `switch_pairs` that accepts a string as a parameter and returns that string with each pair of neighboring letters reversed. If the string has an odd number of letters, the last letter should not be modified. For example, the call `switch_pairs("example")` should return `"xemalpe"` and the call `switch_pairs("hello there")` should return `"ehll ohtree"` .

Note that this function returns a string and does not print anything.

### Requirements

- You should not make a `list` to solve this problem. You should solve it by building up a `str` .
