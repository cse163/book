# ðŸš§ Practice: Minute Countdown

{download}`Download starter code </module-1-introduction-to-python/lesson-2-python-basics/practice-minute-countdown.zip>`

Write a program that counts down from a minute in decrements of 10 seconds using a `for` loop. The output of the program should be the following:  
```text
One minute countdown
60
50
40
30
20
10
0
Done!
````

*Hint: The lines of numbers should all be produced by your for loop while the first and last lines will appear outside the loop (since they only happen once).*   
*
			Hint: Think carefully about what the inputs to 
			*   
##  Requirements  

-  Your solution should use a     `for`     loop and should not use a     `while`     loop.  
-  Your program should use the main-method pattern (we provided the starter code). You do not need to define any other functions for this problem!  

##  Running / Submitting  

-  Remember to run your program you can press the "Run" button or use the terminal by using the command     `python main.py`     (since the name of the file is     `main.py`     ).  
-  To submit your program, you need to press the "Mark" button.
