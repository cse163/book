# 🚧 Practice: Expressions

In this checkpoint, you will test your understanding how to evaluate expressions and to pay attention to their types.  

*Note: This question will tell you if your answer is wrong, and once you get it correct will show the right answer and an explanation.*   

 

## Question 0

What is the output of the following code snippet?  

```python
x = 2.4
y = 1.2
x = x / y
y = 5

print(x ** 2 <= y)
```

Make sure your output is well-formatted!  

-  If your output is an     `int`     value like     `3`     , you should write:  

    -  ```text
        3

        ````


-  If your output is a     `float`     value like     `3.2`     , you should write:  

    -  ```text
        3.2

        ````


-  If your output is a     `bool`     value like     `True`     , you should write (capitalization matters!):  

    -  ```text
        True

        ````
