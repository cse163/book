# <i class="far fa-edit fa-fw"></i> Practice: Quiz

For many lessons, we will ask you to answer some conceptual questions about the concepts you just learned. You should attempt to answer these questions correctly to best help you with your learning.

```{note}
While this version of the book is very new, we don't currently have a way for you to automatically check answers to these conceptual questions. This will be a feature we will be working on soon. In the mean-time, check with your instructor to discuss how to solve these problems.
