# <i class="fas fa-book fa-fw"></i> Lesson 5: Data Structures - Tuple, Set, Dict

## Concepts

The remaining lessons this week are all focused on _data_ and how to represent it in our programs. This lesson focuses on the concept of a **data structure** (something that stores data, e.g. a `list` ) while Lesson 6 will focus on an application of these data structures to represent a particular type of data that is used commonly in programs.

In this lesson, you will learn about the following Python constructs:

- List comprehensions

- Tuples

- Sets

- Dictionaries
