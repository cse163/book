## Question 2

_Select all that apply_ .

Your friend is working on a data analysis project and notices their program is running very slowly for their very large dataset (say 20 GBs large). What might you recommend as good strategies to help them develop their program?

**<i class="far fa-edit fa-fw"></i> Your Task**

Select one or more options. Write your answer down in your own space.

_<i class="far fa-square fa-fw"></i> Option 0_

Change their data processing to access all of the data in a random order rather than using a loop that goes from start to end.

_<i class="far fa-square fa-fw"></i> Option 1_

While developing their code to see if it's correct, work with a smaller version of the data just to make sure the code can run to completion without error before running it on the whole dataset.

_<i class="far fa-square fa-fw"></i> Option 2_

If their analysis is able to finish running, save the results using `pickle` so they can avoid doing the analysis again to recreate their results.

_<i class="far fa-square fa-fw"></i> Option 3_

Look on the internet to see if you can write special code to force Python to store the _entire 20GB_ dataset in a register.
